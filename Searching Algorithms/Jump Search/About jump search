Jump Search

Like Binary Search, Jump Search is a searching algorithm for sorted arrays. The basic idea is to check 
fewer elements (than linear search) by jumping ahead by fixed steps or skipping some elements in place 
of searching all elements. For example, suppose we have an array arr[] of size n and block (to be jumped) 
size m. Then we search at the indexes arr[0], arr[m], arr[2m]…..arr[km] and so on. Once we find the 
interval (arr[km] < x < arr[(k+1)m]), we perform a linear search operation from the index km to find the element x.

In the worst case, we have to do n/m jumps and if the last checked value is greater than the element to 
be searched for, we perform m-1 comparisons more for linear search. Therefore the total number of 
comparisons in the worst case will be ((n/m) + m-1). The value of the function ((n/m) + m-1) will be 
minimum when m = √n. Therefore, the best step size is m = √n.

Important points:

Works only sorted arrays.

The optimal size of a block to be jumped is (√ n). This makes the time complexity of Jump Search O(√ n).

The time complexity of Jump Search is between Linear Search ( ( O(n) ) and Binary Search ( O (Log n) ).

Binary Search is better than Jump Search, but Jump search has an advantage that we traverse back only 
once (Binary Search may require up to O(Log n) jumps, consider a situation where the element to be 
searched is the smallest element or smaller than the smallest). So in a system where binary search is 
costly, we use Jump Search.
