Binary Search: 

Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with 
an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the 
item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise 
narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval 
is empty.

Binary Search Complexity 

Binary search has a worst-case and average-case running time of O(logn), making O(logn) comparisons,
where n is the number of elements in the array.

The worst case occurs when a given target element is not in the list at all.

Binary search has an O(1) best case running time. This occurs when the first midpoint selected is the target
value.
