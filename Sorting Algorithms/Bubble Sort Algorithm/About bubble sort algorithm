Bubble Sort

• Bubble sort is based on the idea of repeatedly
comparing pairs of adjacent elements and then
swapping their positions if they exist in the wrong
order.

• The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are
needed, which indicates that the list is sorted

• The algorithm, is named for the way smaller or larger
elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

• Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and
impractical for most problems . It can be practical if the
input is usually in sorted order but may occasionally
have some out-of-order elements nearly in position.

• Bubble sort has worst-case and average complexity

• Implementation of bubble sort algorithm is left as an
exercise to the students
